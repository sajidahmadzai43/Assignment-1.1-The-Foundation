                    <p class="para">Cities, natural and social environments, organizations and humans generate digital footprints in the form of large real-time data. Going forward into the future, it will be the norm to capture, analyze and present this information in ways that solve complex problems and increase understanding of our environment. Human behavioral patterns, IoT, weather, nature, connected city infrastructures, biological, health and organizational operations are typical of systems generating data now and into the future. Organizations and individuals will rely on analysts capable of providing data science solutions to inform decisions about what to do next in order to be successful in the face of complexity and uncertainty. Students in UATâ€™s Data Science degree will learn to integrate world data, sometimes with the benefit of artificial intelligence and statistical analysis, into analytics, dashboards and software applications. Data Science students will use tools such as Python, ELK and artificial intelligence with embedded systems, and IoT, cloud edge architecture and data lakes with statistical methods, to interact with data and visualize it in ways that create new understandings and value. The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code for Data Science is 30.7001.</p>
    <h4 class="title">DATA SCIENCE DEGREE OBJECTIVES</h4>
		<ol>1. Assess, structure, manage and implement large data sets derived from real-time sources.</ol>
<ol> 2. Compile data from multiple sources, including data selection, data scrubbing and feature engineering, with an emphasis on tidy data and the tidyverse.</ol>
<ol> 3. Apply statistical tests and tools appropriately to analyze data sets drawn from different types of sources (nature,
humankind, organizations, etc.), making inferences and projections from the data.</ol>
<ol> 4. Create visualizations of large data sets in ways that clarify understanding of their meaning and implications.</ol>
<ol> 5. Design and implement big data, artificial intelligence and statistical and visual analysis solutions that provide people and organizations with understanding, guidance and options drawn from the data.</ol>
<ol>6. Demonstrate best practices regarding digital privacy and the ethical use of personal information.</ol>
